A two-player turn-based strategy game. Games are played on a board containing a grid of dots. Players take turns joining two horizontally or vertically adjacent dots with a line. The player that completes the fourth side of a 1 Ã— 1 box gets a point and takes another turn. When all the boxes are complete, the game ends and the player who has the most boxes wins the game.
